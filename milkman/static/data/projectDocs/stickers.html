  <h3 class="resultHeader">Result (TL;DR):</h3>
  <p class="resultText">I created the following set of stickers based on classes in the UMich School of Information. The goal was to develop a consistent style that could be used across numerous specific instances, while exercising my ability to develop original semiotics.</p>

      <h4>Sketching</h4>
      <p>I started with lots of sketches to flesh out my ideas. Particularly when trying to develop easily recognizable icons and semiotics, I found this was particularly helpful, as it got all of the boring and basic ideas out of the way. Here are some of them; I'm not going to show all of the gibberish, as most of it really doesn't pertain.</p>

      <h4>Basic Boi</h4>
      <p>At this point, I was still uninspired, but created the following stickers. I'm including them now not because I think they have value in their final result, but because they showed me what I wanted to avoid. While I like the idea of visualizing the transformation of the student through taking the class, that's about all I like here. These stickers lacked unity, creativity, and any sort of meaningful presence, which directed my next iteration.</p>

      <h4>Starting Over</h4>
      <p>I wanted to create something that people would actually want to put on a laptop or notebook. In a school of designers, this meant it had to have modern, striking visual appeal. At the time, I was also into playing with figure/ground dynamics. All changes and ideas considered, my result is below. I'd be much happier putting these on my notebook.</p>
