  <h3 class="resultHeader">Result (TL;DR):</h3>
  <p class="resultText">CVFC, or College Volunteer Facilitator Corp, is a group of high energy, forward-thinking college students that works in tandem with <a href="https://mascmahs.org/">Michigan Student Leadership</a> to facilitate best-in-class leadership programs for middle and high school students across the country. Aside from regular duties of a CVFC member, I did a lot of work to improve our digital resource management and boost social media engagement. Below are some of my designs and details regarding my social media work for the organization.</p>
  <h3 class="processHeader">Works</h3>

    <li class="processStep">
      <h4>Tweetmaster</h4>
      <p>One of my first larger structural contributions to CVFC was breathing new life into our social media presence. Despite being full of energetic, genuinely fun and original people, our social media presence in 2016 was about as engaging as Snapchat concert videos. I asked I wanted to take over the Michigan Student Leadership (MSL) Twitter, and got the go-ahead.</p>

      <p>I started by totally breaking down all expectations. At the time, we had a convention where we'd try to have an online conversation about leadership by posting prompts and hoping that people responded. In reality, we were largely throwing tweets into the abyss. We still had to post the questions, but decided to do it a different way. Two of my best friends and I created 7 short, absolutely ridiculous and nonsensical videos that framed the prompts. To anyone unfamiliar with the organization, the humor style would probably make no sense, but we knew had a relatively easy-to-please user base as long as we went for it. That was the point of these videos: not necessarily to be great in and of themselves, but to let followers know that the tone was gonna change.</p>

      <p>And change it did. Soon, our tweets didn't just convey information; they had voice and personality. Being 100% proper and fake doesn't sell on social media. It's not a billboard. In the months that I was Tweetmaster (self-given), engagement went up from <b>300% to 1000%</b> compared to the same month of the previous year. Yes, those are real numbers.</p>

      <p>It's important to note that this was not a standalone operation. When our Twitter engagements started skyrocketing, we quickly formed a social media initiative team, with each member managing a different platform. We stayed unified around the relevant content at the time, but in a tone appropriate to our respective platform. To keep things fresh, we started hosting campus takeovers where other CVFC members would post throughout the day, bringing their own personal voice to the platform. In collaboration with another initiative team, we also began hosting live stream conversations once a month that were MUCH more successful than sending textual prompts into the ether.</p>

      <p>Though there are certainly plenty of other factors to consider, we had record participation numbers at our main annual event after our social media resurgence. It certainly didn't hurt.</p>

      <h4>Camp Designs</h4>
      <h5>Social Media Filters</h5>
      <p>In line with boosting social media presence, our fearless leader Matt Alley asked me to create filters for social media pictures that would be taken at our Summer Camp. The Snapchat filter was available through snap via geolocation. I designed the filters to match with the existing theme and logo of that year, pictured below.</p>

      <h5>"Dare to Explore" Camp Logo</h5>

      <h5>Facebook Profile Pic Filter</h5>

      <h5>Wish Box</h5>
      <p>We had this thing at Camp called "Wish Box." The campers would write any camp wish they had on a piece of paper, and A-Team (the warrior elves of Camp) would try to grant as many wishes as possible throughout the week. When one of my best friends, Patty Durell, took over A-Team, she launched Wish Box to legendary status. The next year, we wanted to make sure we were doing everything we could to keep Wish Box at the top.</p>

      <p>While another CVFC friend, Hannah Davenport, focused on making the box itself festive and iconic, I worked with her to create specialized wish cards. I ended up creating the following logo, and the wish box brand was born.</p>

      <h4>Logo Development</h4>
      <p>During my time with CFVC, I was also tasked with developing a logo for the Board of Delegates, which is basically CVFC's high school counterpart. Even though Michigan Student Leadership's branding was about as fractured as it could be at the time (sorry y'all it's facts), I wanted to make this logo as unified with the existing brand as possible. Below is the Michigan Student Leadership logo as it was at the time (minus the full name at the bottom).</p>

      <h5>Final Logo</h5>
      <p>Based on personal preference and the opinions of the Board of Delegates, we settled on this final logo. </p>

      <h4>Other Work</h4>
      <p>This documentation is only a fraction of the work I did with CVFC and MASC, but it is the most relevant to this portfolio. If you want to know more about some of the other work we did, drop me a line and I'd be more than happy to tell you more.</p><br>
