  <h3 class="resultHeader">Result (TL;DR):</h3>
  <p class="resultText">Adhering to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/">Apple's Human Interface Guidelines,</a> I re-created mock-ups and animations of an existing iOS app, <a href="https://www.dreamonapp.com/">Dream:ON,</a> in a more emotionally appropriate tone for the application.</p>
  <h3 class="processHeader">Process</h3>
  <ol class="processList">
    <li class="processStep">
      <h4>(Re)setting the Tone</h4>
      <p>The first step was to assess the existing Dream:ON application and determine where it falls short of connecting with users emotionally. I examined a series of screenshots from the app's website, as it was no longer available for download in me region (though I don't think we were missing much to be honest.) </p>
      <h5>Existing App Screenshots</h5>

      <img src="https://www.dreamonapp.com/img/screenshots/7.jpg" alt="existing Dream:ON soundscape store" class="currentDreamOnIMG">
      <p>In short, I found the app giving me kind of a creepy vibe. Though it promotes helping users take control of their own dreams, it gave me the vibe that IT is going to control my dreams at its own amusement. Bright pink and lime green are not settling colors one wants to see right before bed, particularly not smacked on top of an ever-present Looney-Tunes-esque hypnosis vortex background. So honestly, I felt there was nowhere to go but up here.</p>
      <h5>Mood Board</h5>
      <p>I created the following mood board to guide the aesthetic I was going after throughout the project. I wanted the app to exude a sense of unwavering serenity, while alluding to a vast and expansive power the flows underneath the surface. We want sleep to be safe and easily achievable, but if you're using this app, you probably also want to "unlock" the full potential of your dreams, and, to a lesser extent, your mind.</p>

      <h4>Initial Mock-Ups</h4>
      <p>Since we basically had wireframes from the layouts in the existing application AND the focus of this project is emotional redesign and not how to build a dreaming app, I was able to save time on determining the layouts of most of the screens. I took the feel and some of the assets of my mood board and applied it to the following screens.</p>

      <h4>Improved Designs</h4>
      <p>It's obvious to see that simply following a company's interface guidelines can do a lot of help. There were still a lot of improvements I could make to my work though, and I needed to ensure the designs I created were robust enough for varying media. With feedback from my peers, instructors, and self-critique, I improved the initial mock-ups to the following designs. The icon and logotype also needed a lot of work, though I wouldn't address that until later...</p>

      <h4>Animations</h4>
      <p>Since I've done countless static mobile mockups, I wanted to expand when I was working on this. I decided to practice animations, which I have little experience in outside of CSS. To do this, I decided to learn and use Adobe Animate. Another option was After Effects, but I have a soft spot for vector graphics. I created the following animations after a couple of hours learning how to use Animate. </p>

      <h4>Return of the Logo</h4>
      <p>Returning to this project for documentation, I nearly cried looking at the logo and logotype I considered "finished" the first time around. I can only hope I was pressed for time or temporarily delirious.</p>
      <h5>Previous "Logotype"</h5>
      <img class="bigImage" src="./static/data/img/dreamOn/logo/whyDreamOnLogotype.png" alt="a logotype that I'm not sure why I ever shipped" style="max-width: 50%; left: 0;">
      <h5>A Pedestrian Attempt at an Icon</h5>
      <img class="bigImage" src="./static/data/img/dreamOn/logo/whyDreamOnIcon.svg" alt="a sorry attempt at a cloud icon" style="max-width: 50%; left: 0;">
      <p class="noIndent">Seriously Malc??</p>
      <p class="noIndent">I really do think I had a lot on my plate at the time but that's no real excuse. The logotype is just words in an existing typeface, and the icon looks like a 2nd grader's scribbles. Technical incompetency aside, the icon has poor balance, no sense of movement, and does not relate to the aesthetic of the application as a whole. Since this is pretty much the opposite of the purpose of an icon (and for the sake of my own pride), I needed to revisit this.</p>
      <h5>Revised Logotype & Icon</h5>
      <p>While the "power cloud" icon had potential to give off a big-brother feeling, I really liked the bisociation it was bringing. With some tweaking, I thought I could make it more unified with the rest of the application.</p>
      <p>I ended up creating dozens of iterations, sketched and digital, and came to the following result. The icon and logotype have more circular structural influence, which is prominent in navigation elements throughout the redesigns. These also utilize the golden ratio, which is better than, well, no ratio. </p>
      <img class="bigImage" src="./static/data/img/dreamOn/logo/revisedDreamOnLogotype.svg" alt="revised Dream:On icon" style="max-width: 50%; left: 0">
      <p>Circles also generally convey closure and safety, which as I mentioned before, was part of my goals for the aesthetic of the application. The openings in the circles, however, nod to the expansive possibilities waiting for us in our own mind and dreams.</p>
      <img class="bigImage" src="./static/data/img/dreamOn/logo/revisedDreamOnIcon.svg" alt="revised Dream:On icon" style="max-width: 50%; left: 0">
      <h5>Further Revisions</h5>
      <p>Unfortunately, I was getting a lot of feedback that the "power cloud" icon was, well, looking a bit too much like human body parts. While that's not where MY mind was going, I didn't really want to leave that open to interpretation, especially with a dreaming app. I went back to the drawing board, trying iterations of power icons, dream catchers, infinite paths, and abstract clouds. I did not feel that most of these meshed with the compositional standards and consistent stroke widths that I had established earlier, and an icon made of strokes can quickly get overly complex.</p>
      <p>I ended up settling on the following logotype and icon. Due to its stroke characteristics, the icon remains distinct, despite being pretty traditional in shape. Not hiding another shape within it also improves its scalability. The logotype has more free-flowing movement and improved unity, which is largely due to greater presence and more consistent shaping/rotation of interior curves.</p>
