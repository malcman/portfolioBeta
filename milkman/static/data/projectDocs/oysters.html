  <h3 class="resultHeader">Result (TL;DR):</h3>
  <p class="resultText">While learning about modernism and postmodernism, I created multiple mockups for a landing page of a fictional family farm. At this stage in my life, I found postmodernism to be a more natural style for me to work in.</p>
  <h3 class="processHeader">Process</h3>
  <ol class="processList">
    <li class="processStep">
      <h4>Mood Board</h4>
      <p>I started by creating a mood board that would capture the general aesthetic of the website, regardless of which style it was in. I decided to go for a natural, sustainable feel, as shown below.</p>

      <h4>First Iteration</h4>
      <p>Since the focus of this project was not interaction design, we all worked from a standard landing page wireframe, shown below.</p>
      <h5>Starting Wireframe</h5>

      <p>Having a large part of the layout already dictated, I elected to skip sketching at this early stage of the project. <b>Don't do that; always sketch!</b> Though I ended up satisfied with this project, it took too many iterations and sucked too much time for its net output. This could've been reduced with more sketching. Seriously. Always sketch. Nonetheless, I created the following mock-up as a rough start that could be refined for each style.</p>
      <p>Note: the logotype and branding for the farm are under-developed throughout this project, as that was not a focus for this project.</p>

      <h4>Modernism</h4>
      <p>As I was learning about modernism for the first time while working on this project, I had not yet understood the liberties I could still take while working within the style. At the time, I viewed it as strictly utilitarian, and consequently found myself feeling limited. I knew this was mostly due to my lack of exposure and knowledge, however. One of the first ways I wanted to explore breaking into the style was by creating a sense of movement, which I consider a crucial element of all my work (and is noticeably not present in the first iteration). The result is shown below. It's definitely not my best work, but it accomplishes the goal I wanted it to achieve.</p>

    <li class="processStep">
      <h4>Postmodernism</h4>
      <p>Turning to postmodernism (after having learned more about it) was a breath of fresh air for me. I found it far less constricting and more natural. Instead of having to curb my innate sense of meta-sarcasm, I was allowed, nay, encouraged, to embrace it. Check it out below.</p>

      <h4>Is Anything Ever Done??</h4>
      <p>In preparing this project to be posted here, I found a couple of errors that I needed to address before I felt the project could be displayed. These updates are already integrated above. Most of them were beginner's mistakes like legibility, but I wanted to included this section of returning to work for the following reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I'm not trying to lie about when this was worked on.</li>
        <li>Most creations can usually be refined, especially after they simmer for a little bit. There is no shame in iterating.</li>
        <li>Always sketch (@ myself).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
