			<p>Aside from learning agile development and project management strategies, I've spent a lot of time working with teams and students across disciplines and skill levels. We need each other to get things done, and I continuously work to foster a trusting, safe, and fun workplace.</p>
			<p>The things I make are for people and with people.
			You can't solve problems with just a smart brain; a lot of people have that.</p>

					<p>Okay. This is probably a section that my friends and advisors would tell me not to have, but I've been thinking about it basically my whole time building this site. It feels wrong to not say anything about it.</p><br>
					<p>While developing a website entirely dedicated to oneself, it's natural to start thinking you must be a pretty big egoist to find all of this so necessary.</p><br>
					<p>At the same time, I believe there is a lot of value in documentation, and showing what you know, not just saying it. I hope this is what can be taken away from this site, instead of the impression of a swollen head.</p><br>
					<p>My ego isn't dead. It's alive and well; I'm not claiming enlightenment. BUT, I do strongly believe that ego has far too large of a presence in tech as we know it. I also believe we can change that. If you and I end up working together, you have my word you'll actually be working <i>with</i> me.</p><br>
					<p>All this being said, I hope you enjoy exploring this site, and find something useful, exciting, or just plain weird that gets you thinking.</p>
