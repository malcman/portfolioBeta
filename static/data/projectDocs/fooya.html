  <h3 class="resultHeader">Result (TL;DR):</h3>
  <p class="resultText">Our capstone team worked with a remote startup, FriendsLearn Inc., to improve the user experience of their application, <i>Fooya!</i>. We completed target user research, redesigned key interactions, and laid a framework for the compnay's future UX development.</p>

      <h4>Getting Accquainted</h4>
      <p>The first half of our Capstone experience was spent getting accquainted with the student team and FriendsLearn Inc., our partner for the year. FriendsLearn uses gameful learning as a "digital vaccine" to combat lifestyle-induced diseases. They are aiming to instill healthy habits in kids that will persist throughout their lives. FriendsLearn is a startup based in California and India, far from the University of Michigan. As a result, all contact with the client was remote, and often had to account for variance in time zones.</p>
      <p>The first semester of the project was spent developing a team charter, taking care of legal IP documents, and formulating an appropriate project scope. We also conducted interviews with experts in youth health and game design, as these were areas we felt we needed more exposure to.</p>

      <h4>Heuristic & Competitive Analysis</h4>
      <p>Having conducted proper background research, we began with a competitive analysis of the market space to orient ourselves with the company's business needs and possibly find new ones. This was done with an excel table of competitors and important metrics or features, followed by a qualitative report detailing these. Due to NDA agreements, I cannot share the contents of this report.</p>
      <p>My teammate Sara and I also conducted a heuristic analysis of the application using two sets of heuristics: Neilsen's Usability Heuristics (classic) and a set of Mobile Game Heuristics initially developed by Hannu Korhonen. While not perfect, they do provide a helpful lens through which we could assess the application. Korhonen provides a range of heuristics across the following five categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Context-aware</li>
        <li>Multiplayer</li>
        <li>Gameplay</li>
        <li>Game Usability</li>
        <li>Mobility</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For the purposes and scope of our study, only Mobility, Gameplay, and Game Usability were assessed. Nonetheless, these analyses provided us a very solid groundwork to move forward with. Not only did they allow us to identify problem areas, we could also assign severity and priority recommendations, and cite our reasons why/the set of violated heuristics for each problem area.</p>
