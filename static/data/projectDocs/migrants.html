  <h3 class="resultHeader">Result (TL;DR):</h3>
  <p class="resultText">Our graphic design class created personalized and generalized works that commemorated refugees who died or went missing on their journey. Our work received NCID, UARTS, and UMSI Diversity grants. The pieces will be displayed in an exhibit as soon as an appropriate one is chosen. Most importantly, the families of the migrants received some validation and attention to their heartbreaking loss that government entities refuse to acknowledge. Our work won't bring them back, but it does its best to honor them and their memory.</p>

      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>We began meeting with Dr. Odessa Gonzales Benson, a local liaison for Memories of the Mediterranean, an project aiming to help give voice and visibility to missing migrants (particularly in the Mediterranean region). The project is in collaboration with La Terre Pour Tous, a migrant advocacy group based in Tunisia.</p>
      <p>Dr. Benson first explained the plight many refugees are facing. Migrants are forced to leave their home, possessions, and loved ones behind due to political persecution, resource shortage, or war. Stories of the hardships these people face are often reduced, hidden, or completely neglected in the media. The goal of Memories of the Mediterranean, and by extension, the work we would do for them, was to bring attention to their stories and faces. If you want to learn more on this, I encourage you to do more research, as I am hardly a verified resource on the matter.</p>
      <p>There are plenty of initiatives that already exist trying to bring attention to the migrants' crisis, but those that we found came across too impersonal to me. One such example is <a href="https://missingmigrants.iom.int/">missingmigrants.iom.int.</a> The data seems solid, but is ultimately kind of cold. It is hard to get a sense of the human lives lost when just looking at numbers, commas, and figures.</p>
      <p>La Terre Pour Tous provided us with limited information on a select group of people; family members left behind, a few (low-res) photos, and a short story about their experience. We were each assigned representing two people in our work. Some of us were given higher quality assets (images, stories, etc.) than others, but that is the nature of a political project telling the story of forgotten people. It was our job as designers to integrate what we could.</p>

      <h4>Defining the Message</h4>
      <p>In working with such a heavy topic, I wanted to find a way to respectfully commemorate those missing while maintaining impact, and possibly include a call to action.</p>
      <p>As with most things, I started by developing a color palette to work with. I did not want to choose lightly, as these were very personal stories, and color holds varying significance across cultures. After doing research on color in Islam and the middle east, I came to a deep, muted palette of black, green, purple, and accents of gold. Black has ties representing peace and mourning, purple alludes to calm mysticism of the unknown, and green (being the royal color of Islam), which symbolizes life, hope, and Paradise. The gold was also meant to represent hope and better times to come (plus I needed some lighter color in there).</p>
      <p>With the my given assets and color palette now in place, I developed my first poster. I wanted it to have a call to action for all of us viewing it, helping us recognize that this was not so external to our lives. My first draft is below.</p>
      <h5>First Draft Poster</h5>

      <h4>Refinement</h4>
      <p>While the above poster starting alluding to what I wanted to accomplish, it was not where I wanted it to be. It lacked unity, and was trying to do too much with the visuals, while not doing enough with the content.</p>
      <p>Until this point, I had felt constrained by the assets I was given. Then I realized this was a lame excuse, and I was the only one limiting myself. I could include exactly as much as I wanted to. I scrapped the noise and returned to modernism. Check them out below.</p>

      <h4>Data Visualization</h4>
      <p>As we were beginning a data visualization unit, we decided we wanted to stay within this message. It wouldn't be the families or exhibition, but more to push our own boundaries. It's hard to care about making visualizations of how tofu affects bone health after contemplating overlooked human lives.</p>
      <p>Part of the problem with this, however, is the very fact that there is not enough existing data about missing migrants, globally or in the Mediterranean. Having learned my lesson with the assets, however, I decided to work conceptually, under the premise that this data did exist. My week-long graphic design problem was not going to bring true numeric clarity to an international crisis.</p>
      <p>This time, I wanted to shift the narrative a bit. Instead of a ethos-based call to action, I wanted to bring attention to the families left behind, and the how the lack of acknowledgment or assumption of responsibility was tearing apart people's homes and communities. It reminded me of a stray string on a sock; rip it off with haste, and soon the whole garment will deteriorate to nothing but a pile of strings.</p>
      <p>I wanted to translate this to a map, which could also show the journeys of those missing. The more missing migrants from a community, the more "unraveled" that area would be. In an interactive version of this, a journey strand could be selected. Upon selection, a more personal story would be revealed. Thus, the visualization simultaneously displays international scale of the problem and how it affects entire countries, while not losing focus on the individual lives lost.</p>
